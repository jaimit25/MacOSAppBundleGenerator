This repository contains Script to Generate AppBundle for MacOSX without XCode, By-default it is set to Cpp executable file. (path to Update executable file(main) :  /Contents/MacOS/main).

### Direction to use :
- To create your own executable file add your (Cpp file, with name set to main.cpp) code to exeFile folder and run the script "bash writer.sh".
- Executable file is the Code/Task which is to be Run or Processed.

### To Build AppBundle run shell script: 
```
$ bash writer.sh
```
### To Build AppBundle using wx-widget or fltk GUI Library use the Source Code from "main" branch and run the Program run.cpp.
- (Note: the c++ file in the exeFile Directory should have first line as "//wx" to compile wx program or //"fltk" for fltk program).
- wxmac and fltk should be pre-installed.(use homebrew).

```
$ brew install wxmac && brew install fltk && g++ run.cpp -o run
```
